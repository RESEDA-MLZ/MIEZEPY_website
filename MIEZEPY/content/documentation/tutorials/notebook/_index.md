# Tutorials on Jupyter notebooks

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/about) is a major project aimed at moving python from the classical terminal view to a more user friendly notebook format. This way of using python took the world by storm and is a serious contender to rigid GUI's when it comes to quick usability and flexibility. MIEZEPY was first developed and tested on this format and can therefore be run there easily.
