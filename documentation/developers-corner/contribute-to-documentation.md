## Contribute to documentation 

Here we explain how to make change in the documentation and make it available online.

### General information

GitHub is configured to host our content at [this address](https://reseda-mlz.github.io/MIEZEPY_website).

Users are modifying site content by providing pull requests to `master` branch. 

To modify documentation follow these steps:


### Fork documentation repository

Make a fork of our [site repository](https://github.com/RESEDA-MLZ/MIEZEPY_website) and clone your fork locally.


### Modify the documentation

Modify one of documentation related markdown file. For example, to modify the page you are looking at right now, edit
```
<source>/content/documentation/developers-corner/contribute-to-documentation.md
```


### Provide a pull request

When you are happy with the changes you've made, push changes to the `origin` and provide a pull request.


> Members of [RESEDA-MLZ](https://github.com/RESEDA-MLZ) have rights to merge their own pull requests.
> External users will have to wait a bit for a person with admin rights to approve.

After pull request merge, check site [online](https://reseda-mlz.github.io/MIEZEPY_website).
It might take a few minutes before changes will be propagated to hosting service.

Because of browser cashing you might need to reload the page from scratch (e.g. push `reload` button while holding `shift` key).
