## About

The Software package MIEZEPY has been developed by the RESEDA staff together with [Alexander Schober](https://github.com/AlexanderSchober) from the Scientific Computing group of the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (JCNS-MLZ).
The Software is currently overhauled as part of the [DAPHNE4NFDI](https://www.daphne4nfdi.de/english/) initiative to support the Nexus dataformat and to make it more sustainable in the long term.
The team members responsible for this are [Christoph Herb](https://github.com/christophherb) (until June 2024) and [Iryna Lypova](https://github.com/ilypova). 

All the nitty-gritty details of MIEZEPY can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/ab497d)!

And if you want to know more about [MIEZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRw1zfD6Mo) itself or [RESEDA](https://mlz-garching.de/reseda) the instrument which inspired all this work, follow the links.
