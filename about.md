## About

The Software package MIEZEPY has been developed by the RESEDA staff together with [Alexander Schober](https://github.com/AlexanderSchober) from the Scientific Computing group of the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (JCNS-MLZ).
All the nitty-gritty details of MIEZEPY can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/ab497d)!
