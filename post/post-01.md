# The MIEZEPY website is live
The website has been designed using the already present [scmlz hugo theme](https://github.com/scgmlz/hugo-theme-scgdoc). This allowed a fast implementation. The website aims at providing important news as well as installation instructions. A few how-to's and tutorials will also be proposed in the long term.
